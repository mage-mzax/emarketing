Mzax's Emarketing is a Magento extension, allowing you to create automated marketing campaigns 
that run for a set period of time and target customers determined by multiple filters.

Send emails to a specific group of your customers, whom you can easily define via a combination of filters.

Create automated campaigns that will check for new recipients at any specified interval 
(e.g. birthdays, abandoned shopping carts, order confirmation).

This project is currently in an early beta release, but it is already quite powerful. My focus during development was three-fold:

 - Easy to use. 
   Very little coding (or even no coding) is required. 
   Most tasks can be accomplished without any coding experience. 
   This makes it great for marketing professionals who don’t want to deal with the hassle of coding.
   
 - Flexible and open. 
   With a minimum of skills, you can take things a step further and create 
   even more powerful and personalised campaigns. As a developer you can extend and improve 
   your campaigns in order to create custom functionality to suit your needs.
   
 - Strong reporting. 
   Collecting data is great, but using it is better. 
   Top-knotch analytics are important for determining if a campaign works or not. 
   I will try my best to aggregate the data and present it in a way that makes sense to the 
   largest number of people possible.
